Hey coffee lovers. I went to the Broiler today and I had an empty cup for a long time. Usually they are pretty good. Sometimes they bring a pot, but the waiter wanted to serve one cup at a time. And they had a lot of servers so I donâ€™t know what the deal was. But their coffee is pretty good, it was hot, and freshly brewed.
